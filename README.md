# simple-Todo-List-add-and-delete-
This is a simple version of a to-do list with two functionalities: adding and deleting tasks. You can add a to-do element and delete it as well. During the development, I utilized basic concepts like arrays,
objects, and generating HTML within the JavaScript code. I didn't focus much on styling; rather, my priority was ensuring the functionalities worked correctly. If you have any feedback or notice any issues with the
script, please let me know. Thank you!
